# wielding-gun-prediction
a machine learning mode to deal with wielding gun prediction

train folder contains an example file of the data
task3 folder contains data with lifetime information, sorted by wielding gun number

preprocess.py: preprocess original data from train folder

task2.ipynb: task1 and task2 have same code except the target

task3.ipynb: code to predict the lifetime of the wielding gun

task3_data_tag.py: original data do not habve lifetime information, we use this file to generate the lifetime information, the output result is saved in task3 folder
